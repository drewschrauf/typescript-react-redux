_**Now with 100% less Redux!**_

## What is this?

This is a basic example project using the following technologies to build a web app:

- Typescript
- React
- React Router
- Vanilla Extract
- Vite

And for testing:

- Jest
- react-testing-library

## What happened to Redux?

It turns out that with the power of hooks, you really don't need Redux anymore. If you can't live without it, you'll find that the types used for the reducer and actions here work just as well for Redux.
